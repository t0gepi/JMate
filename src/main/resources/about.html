<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Engine</h4>
            Choose the engine you want to use. <br>
            <b>Note:</b> If you want to play chess variants, you will need to use FairyStockfish since it's the only engine that supports variants. <br>
            <b>Note:</b> Selecting any other Engine than FairyStockfish will therefore set the variant to standard chess. <br>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Variant</h4>
            Choose the variant you want to play. <br>
            If you are unfamiliar with the variants, you can read more about them <a href="https://lichess.org/variant">here</a>. <br>
            <b>Note:</b> Selecting any variant other than standard chess will set the engine to FairyStockfish. <br>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Opening</h4>
            Choose the preferred opening you want to play. <br>
            <b>Note:</b> when using autoplay, the opening will only be played if opponent plays theory<br>
            <b>Note:</b> Arrows only display moves of the selected opening if opponent plays theory
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Depth</h4>
            Set the depth of the engine. <br>
            <b>Note:</b> The higher the depth, the longer the engine will take to find the best move. <br>
            <b>Tip:</b> For low time control use a low depth and autoplay
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Start</h4>
            When pressed, the bot will wait until a game is found and then play(if autoplay is enabled) with your settings. <br>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Autoplay</h4>
            If enabled, the bot will do the moves automatically using the settings.<br>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Arrows</h4>
            If enabled, the bot will show the best moves of the selected opening using arrows. <br>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <h4>Hotkey</h4>
            Press this button and then select a key to act as a hotkey.
            When autoplay is disabled, pressing the hotkey will stop the bot from calculating.<br>
            The Bot will then play the best move it has found so far.
            To unset a hotkey, press the button and click the delete key.<br>
